# The Edge Sports Center

We received three free training hours to use at The Edge Sports Center.
Availability was limited and we know girls may rush to get there by 4:15pm, but
do your best and jump in as you can. These sessions are optional. There are
plenty of slots for each hour available. Each player is welcome to attend one
session. Sign up for the one session that works best for you. If space fills up
for a time you need, let me know.

Come prepared to train for the hour. Cleats and shin guards are required.

# Loveland Sports Park

The team manager will be sending out additional sign-ups for other trainings as
soon as we get through these sessions. Each player will be invited to sign up
for at least 2 sessions from 6 different dates available. These sessions will
all be held at Loveland Sports Park. Please be thinking about which two dates
will work best for you:

Sign-ups coming soon... Please check back later.
