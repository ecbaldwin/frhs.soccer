optional.

# The Edge Sports Center

We received three free training hours to use at The Edge Sports Center.
Availability was limited and we know girls may rush to get there by 4:15pm, but
do your best and jump in as you can. These sessions are optional. There are
plenty of slots for each hour available. Each player is welcome to attend one
session. Sign up for the one session that works best for you. If space fills up
for a time you need, let me know.

Come prepared to train for the hour. Cleats and shin guards are required.
