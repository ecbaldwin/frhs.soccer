***Note that the training originally scheduled for the 13th of January has been
moved to the football turf at FRHS***

The FRHS Girls soccer coaches have coordinated a series of pre-season open
trainings. Sessions are open to anyone considering trying out for FRHS Girls
Soccer. Players are encouraged to sign up for a MAX of 2 trainings. <!--more-->
Space is being capped so that the coaches can provide higher quality sessions
with each group/player. If you need to carpool, plan accordingly and sign up
together. Be sure to note your player's name in the "comments", not the parent
name.

In the event of any training cancellations due to weather, these will not be
rescheduled and we will most likely be unable to fill in players from missed
sessions into the other sessions.

Thank you!

Location: [Loveland Sports Park (Turf)][lsp] (Training on 13th of January has
been moved to the football turf at FRHS)
