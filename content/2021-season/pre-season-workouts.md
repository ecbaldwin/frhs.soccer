title: "Pre-season Training and Tryouts"
---

We know this is an uncertain time for us all, but we would like to do our best
to provide something the girls can look ahead to.

As for pre-season trainings and tryouts, we expect to begin trainings around the
1st or 2nd week of April 2021. Tryouts will be slated (tentative) for the week
of April 19th. Team practices begin April 26th per CHSAA rules.

Due to lack of field space as a result of the revised seasons, we may be unable
to hold any trainings at the high school. More details will be released as we
get closer.
