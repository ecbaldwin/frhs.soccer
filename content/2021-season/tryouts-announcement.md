Registration is now open for all players looking to tryout for FRHS girls
soccer.  You will need to view the [FRHS athletic website][frhs-athletics] for
full instructions with links. (Look for the section titled "*Instructions below
for athletic high school sports packet*")

In Summary, each player must:

1. Complete a player registration via sports engine
1. Turn in their annual athletic physical
1. Pay the athletic fee for soccer via School Pay

This is the player's responsibility. ***Players must get a pass/orange card from
the athletic office*** to verify all of this is completed ***before*** they will
be permitted to attend tryouts or any preseason camps.  No exceptions are
allowed. If you have any questions regarding the meeting or registration
requirements you will need to speak with the FRHS athletic office.

Tryouts will run the week beginning Monday, April 26th. We don't know times yet
but we will communicate that when we do.
