During the meeting, we will discuss optional pre-season training (to begin Jan.
15th), tryout schedule (slated for the week of Feb. 21st), fundraising, team
gear ordering information, and much more. We have a packed agenda for the hour
and a full calendar to present.

for zoom will be communicated via the list. Also reach out if it is getting
close and you have not received it.
