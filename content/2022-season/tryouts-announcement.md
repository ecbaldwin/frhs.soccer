We will hold our first informational meeting via zoom on Tuesday, Nov. 2nd at 7
pm. Any players interested in playing in the spring of 2022 (returning and new)
should have at least one person in attendance.

During the meeting, we will discuss optional pre-season training (to begin Jan.
15th), tryout schedule (slated for the week of Feb. 21st), fundraising, team
gear ordering information, and much more. We have a packed agenda for the hour
and a full calendar to present.
